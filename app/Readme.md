First, tou need to install the composer by

composer install

At first you must create a database name 'coding_challenge' in mysql

Right after that migrate all db tables in to it.

Then just run npm install for installing all package dependency

In this project I created a category api and you can access by using right endpoint

/api/categories

Just test and insert data in to db but don't forget to register yourself in to system

Thank's experience was great :)
